### Some informal steps in Data Engineering

*(the discipline took precedence over the previously intended curriculum for the second semester of 2020 as things developed)*

- the main goal is to sketch a somewhat formal yet asymmetric curriculum out of general ideas collected from:
	- nicely written job postings;
	- people in the industry;
	- the great folk at [Datahackers](https://datahackers.com.br/).

- most of the emerging exercises and overall experimentation will end up here;

- not at all intended as a portfolio (when it ever gets done, it will be elsewhere).
